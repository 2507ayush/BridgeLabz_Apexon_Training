# BridgeLabz_Apexon_Training

# Day 1 -> (22/12/25): 
    * Learned basic Git commands. 
    * Implemented them on the particular Repository.
    * Solved different type of merge conflicts.
    
    Commands Studied - 
      # init       → Initializes a new Git repository in the current folder
      # push       → Uploads local commits to the remote repository (GitHub)
      # status     → Shows the current state of working directory and staging area
      # pull       → Fetches and merges latest changes from the remote repository
      # checkout   → Switches branches or restores files (older but powerful command)
      # rebase     → Reapplies commits on top of another branch for clean history
      # branch     → Lists, creates, or deletes branches
      # switch     → Switches between branches (modern & safer than checkout)
      # diff       → Shows differences between files, commits, or branches
      # add        → Stages files so they are ready to be committed
      # commit     → Saves staged changes to the repository with a descriptive message

# Day 2 -> (23/12/25):
    * Learning Conventional Commits in Git. 
    * Learning different Linux command and practically testing them.
    * Implementing all the commands and there use on the particular repository

    Conventional Commits Studied - 
      # initial           → First commit that sets up the project structure
      # feat              → Adds a new feature or functionality to the project
      # fix               → Fixes a bug or issue in the existing code
      # chore             → Non-feature tasks like cleanup, config, or tooling updates
      # dependencies      → Updates or modifies production dependencies
      # devDependencies   → Updates dependencies used only during development
      # peerDependencies  → Updates peer dependency requirements for compatibility
      # metadata          → Changes project metadata (version, author, repo info, etc.)

    Linux Commands studied - 
      # ls        → Lists files and folders in the current directory
      # pwd       → Shows the current working directory path
      # cd        → Changes the current directory
      # mkdir     → Creates a new directory
      # rmdir     → Deletes an empty directory
      # rm        → Deletes files or directories
      # touch     → Creates a new empty file
      # cp        → Copies files or directories
      # mv        → Moves or renames files or directories
      # cat       → Displays file content in the terminal
      # less      → Views file content page by page
      # head      → Shows the first few lines of a file
      # tail      → Shows the last few lines of a file
      # chmod     → Changes file or directory permissions
      # chown     → Changes file or directory ownership
      # grep      → Searches for a pattern in files
      # find      → Searches for files and directories

      # man       → Shows the manual/help page for a command
