# Day 1: 
    * Learned basic Git commands. 
    * Implemented them on the particular Repository.
    * Solved different type of merge conflicts.
    
    Commands Studied - 
      # init       → Initializes a new Git repository in the current folder
      # push       → Uploads local commits to the remote repository (GitHub)
      # status     → Shows the current state of working directory and staging area
      # pull       → Fetches and merges latest changes from the remote repository
      # checkout   → Switches branches or restores files (older but powerful command)
      # rebase     → Reapplies commits on top of another branch for clean history
      # branch     → Lists, creates, or deletes branches
      # switch     → Switches between branches (modern & safer than checkout)
      # diff       → Shows differences between files, commits, or branches
      # add        → Stages files so they are ready to be committed
      # commit     → Saves staged changes to the repository with a descriptive message

# Day 2:
    * Learning Conventional Commits in Git. 
    * Learning different Linux command and practically testing them.
    * Implementing all the commands and there use on the particular repository
