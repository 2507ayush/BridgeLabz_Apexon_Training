# BridgeLabz_Apexon_Training

# Day 1 -> (22/12/25): 
    * Learned basic Git commands. 
    * Implemented them on the particular Repository.
    * Solved different type of merge conflicts.
    
    Commands Studied - 
      # init       → Initializes a new Git repository in the current folder
      # push       → Uploads local commits to the remote repository (GitHub)
      # status     → Shows the current state of working directory and staging area
      # pull       → Fetches and merges latest changes from the remote repository
      # checkout   → Switches branches or restores files (older but powerful command)
      # rebase     → Reapplies commits on top of another branch for clean history
      # branch     → Lists, creates, or deletes branches
      # switch     → Switches between branches (modern & safer than checkout)
      # diff       → Shows differences between files, commits, or branches
      # add        → Stages files so they are ready to be committed
      # commit     → Saves staged changes to the repository with a descriptive message

# Day 2 -> (23/12/25):
    * Learning Conventional Commits in Git. 
    * Learning different Linux command and practically testing them.
    * Implementing all the commands and there use on the particular repository

    Conventional Commits Studied - 
      # initial           → First commit that sets up the project structure
      # feat              → Adds a new feature or functionality to the project
      # fix               → Fixes a bug or issue in the existing code
      # chore             → Non-feature tasks like cleanup, config, or tooling updates
      # dependencies      → Updates or modifies production dependencies
      # devDependencies   → Updates dependencies used only during development
      # peerDependencies  → Updates peer dependency requirements for compatibility
      # metadata          → Changes project metadata (version, author, repo info, etc.)

    Linux Commands studied - 
      # ls        → Lists files and folders in the current directory
      # pwd       → Shows the current working directory path
      # cd        → Changes the current directory
      # mkdir     → Creates a new directory
      # rmdir     → Deletes an empty directory
      # rm        → Deletes files or directories
      # touch     → Creates a new empty file
      # cp        → Copies files or directories
      # mv        → Moves or renames files or directories
      # cat       → Displays file content in the terminal
      # less      → Views file content page by page
      # head      → Shows the first few lines of a file
      # tail      → Shows the last few lines of a file
      # chmod     → Changes file or directory permissions
      # chown     → Changes file or directory ownership
      # grep      → Searches for a pattern in files
      # find      → Searches for files and directories
      # clear     → Clears the terminal screen
      # man       → Shows the manual/help page for a command

# Day 3 -> (24/12/25):
    * Revising all the previous Git and Linux Commands
    * Exploring some more Git commands and there usage 
    
      # config      - Sets or gets Git configuration (username, email, editor, aliases)
      # help        - Displays help information for Git commands
      # version     - Shows the installed Git version
      # restore     - Restores files in the working tree
      # reset       - Unstages changes or moves HEAD to a previous commit
      # stash       - Temporarily saves uncommitted changes
      # stash pop   - Applies and removes the latest stash
      # stash apply - Applies a stash without removing it
      # clean       - Removes untracked files and directories
      # tag         - Creates, lists, or deletes tags
      # show        - Shows details of a commit or object
      # cherry-pick - Applies a specific commit from another branch
      # blame       - Shows who last modified each line of a file
      # reflog      - Shows history of HEAD and branch movements
      # bisect      - Finds the commit that introduced a bug
      # archive     - Creates an archive (zip/tar) of the repository
      # worktree    - Manages multiple working trees
      # grep        - Searches for text in repository files
